## Notes for AI Context Use

- **MCP: Enabled** indicates the service is available for context-aware AI code generation or suggestions.
- Update this file whenever a service is added, removed, or integrated with MCP.
- Do **not** commit sensitive data. Tokens should be stored securely in `.env`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, or managed via the service providerâ€™s dashboard.
